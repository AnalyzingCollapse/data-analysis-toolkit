# data-analysis-toolkit
Building a students toolkit for analysis which currently includes web-scraping, API/XML requests, parsing unstructured data, basic string, list and formatting programs as well as a document  (cosine) similarity.  This will of course grow to a professional tool kit which I can use to assist in business intelligence, market research or data analysis endeavors
